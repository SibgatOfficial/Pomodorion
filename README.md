# Pomodorion

## Overview
I created Pomodorion, a Pomodoro Timer, to help manage work and break intervals effectively. It features a 25-minute focus session, a 5-minute short break, and a 15-minute long break after every 4 sessions. The design is minimalist to keep distractions at bay and maintain focus.

## Features
25-Minute Focus Sessions: Enhance productivity with dedicated focus periods.
5-Minute Short Breaks: Take brief breaks to rest and recharge.
15-Minute Long Breaks: After every 4 focus sessions, take a longer break to refresh.
Minimalist Design: Simple and clean user interface to minimize distractions.
Session Tracking: Keep track of completed Pomodoro sessions.

##Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and layout of the application.
CSS3: For styling and visual design.
JavaScript: For core functionality and interactivity.
